# kodlamaIoDevs

We want to write a project where we bring candidates' coding skills together with employers.
Project name: Kodlama.io.Devs
Let's start with a simple requirement.

âœ” Write codes that can add, delete, update, list, and fetch programming languages (C#, Java, Python). Make it completely in memory.
âœ” Names cannot be repeated.
âœ” Programming language cannot be left blank. (Solve algorithmically by writing code without using validation)
